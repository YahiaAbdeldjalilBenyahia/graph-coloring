# Heuristic informative
In the notebook we explored a couple of heuristics used to color a graph (DSATUR, Welsh & Powell, IDO and RLF), tested each one on the benchmarks.
After that we used Branch And Bound with the implemented heuristics for evaluating before exploring (for prunning purposes).
After that we assign a heuristic to color a graph based on it's classification, we implemented some functions to tell whether
a graph is from a certain class (tree-like, sparse-random, dense-random, planar, bipartite...)
